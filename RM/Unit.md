 - Re - search
- leads to an invention or discovery
- Formal definitions - 
	- defining and redefining problems
	- formulating hypothesis or suggested solutions
	- collecting, organizing and evaluating data
#### Types
- **D vs A, A vs F, Q vs Q, C vs E**
- **Descriptive**  
	- Major purpose of descriptive research is description of the state of affairs as it exists at present  
	- Researcher has no control over the variables
	- Use comparison and correlation 
- **Analytical**
	- Draw inference from something
	- Researcher has to use facts and information already available and analyze these to make a critical evaluation  
- **Applied** 
	- Immediate problem facing society or an industrial business organization aimed at conclusions. Ex - Market research, design, safety, health etc.
- **Fundamental**
	- Mainly concerned with generalizations and with the formulation of theory
	- Usually "Pure" (Pure math or science)
	- Research concerning some natural phenomenon or relating to pure mathematics are examples. Similarly, research studies, concerning human behavior carried on with a view to make generalizations about human
- **Quantitative**
	- based on the measurement of quantity or amount
	- controlled, easy to carry out
	- objective and repeatable
	- easy to draw conclusions and decisions
- **Qualitative**
	- is concerned with qualitative phenomenon, i.e., involving quality or kind 
	- aim is to discover the underlying motives of human behavior; attitude or opinion research (how people feel or think about a particular subject)
	- difficult job; should seek guidance from experimental psychologists
- **Conceptual** 
	- related to some abstract ideas or theory, generally used by philosophers
	- research by Newton, Einstein.
- **Empirical** 
	- relies on experience or observation alone, without due regard for system and theory. Data based research, coming up with conclusions which are capable of being verified by observation or experiment.
	- you are not the first one trying
	- research by Edison. Incandescent bulb
#### Approaches
- Quantitative 
	- Inferential - Form a database from which to infer statistics. Usually means a sample of the population is studied and characteristics are determined, and these are inferred onto the entire population
	- Experimental - Much greater control over the research environment. Some variables are manipulated to see their effect on other variables.
	- Simulation - Useful for building models for understanding future conditions using an artificial environment
- Qualitative
	- concerned with the subjective assessment of attitudes, opinions and behavior
	- usually conducted through focus groups, projective techniques and depth interviews 
#### Significance
- Market
	- investigation of the structure and development  of a market for the purpose of formulating efficient policies for purchasing, production and sales
- Operations
	- refers to the application of what can be termed as optimization problems, cost minimization or of profit maximization
- Motivational
	- includes determining why people behave as they do is mainly concerned with market characteristics. In other words, it is concerned with the determination of motivations underlying the consumer (market) behavior
#### Method vs Methodology
- Method : Technique adopted to conduct research
	- data collection methods
	- statistical techniques
	- evaluation methods
- Methodology : Way in which research problem is solved systematically. Science of studying how research is done. How to apply what methods and when.

- procedure should be clearly defined (so other people can repeat)
- design of research should be carefully planned 
- Report should be truthful, show all flaws
- Analysis should be sufficiently adequate, method of analysis should be appropriate 
- conclusion should be confined to those justified by data of research
Good research is 
1. Systematic
2. Logical
3. Empirical
4. Replicable
#### Research Problem
- "A research problem is a specific issue, difficulty, contradiction or gap in knowledge that you will aim to address in your research" 
- Conditions for a RP
	- I = Individual
	- N = eNvironment
	- C$_1$,C$_2$ = two Courses of action
	- O$_1$,O$_2$ = two Outcomes
	- Then, *P(O$_1$ | I, C$_1$ , N ) != P(O$_1$ | I, C$_2$ , N ).* The choices must have unequal efficiencies for the desired outcomes
- 5 elements of a problem statement
	- Topic : Subject area
	- Social work issue: A concern/problem needing a solution
	- Evidence for the issue : Evidence from literature, from practical experience
	- Deficiencies in Evidence : What is missing, what do we need to know more
	- Remedies of Deficiencies : How the solution helps researches, policy makers, persons in the field, and so on
- Sources of RP
	- Experience 
	- Previous Research
	- Existing Theory
	- Social Issues
	- Brainstorming
	- Intuitions
	- Exposure to field situations
	- Consultation with experts
- Selecting a RP
	- Subject should not be overdone
	- Controversial subjects should be avoided
	- Avoid vague problems
	- Subject should be familiar and feasible
	- Ask yourself
		- Whether you are well equipped in terms of your background to carry out the research
		- Whether it falls in budget
		- Whether the necessary cooperation can be obtained from those who must participate in research as subjects
	- Selection must be preceded by preliminary study
- All the relevant factors should be in the statement

#### Research Design
- Design decisions revolve around the following questions
	- what is the study about
	- why is the study being made
	- where will it be carried out
	- what kind of data is required
	- where can data be found
	- and more
- Breakdown
	- Sampling Design : deals with the method of selecting items
	- Observational Design : Relates to the conditions under which the observations have to be made
	- Statistical Design : concerns with the question of how many items are to be observed and how the information and data fathered gathered are to be analyzed 
	- Operational Design : deals with techniques by which the procedures specified in the sampling, statistical and observational designs can be carried out
- Need for RD
	- Facilitates smooth sailing of research operations
	- makes it efficient
- Features of a good design
	- flexible, appropriate, efficient, economical, and more
	- minimizes bias and maximizes the reliability of data
	- gives low experimental error
	- yields maximal information 
- Concepts
	- Dependent and independent variables : 
		a concept which can take on different values. continuous or discon / discrete. independent and dependent. Age (inde / con) Height(dep / disc). 
	- Extraneous variables
		independent variable that are not related to the purpose of the study, but may affect the dependent variable. we want relation between smoking -> cancer, but age(extra) also affects cancer. 
	- control
		can refer to when we design the study minimizing the effects of extraneous independent variables, or can refer to restrained experimental conditions 
	- confounded relationship
		when the dependent variable is not free from the influence of extraneous variable(s), the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is said to be confounded by an extraneous variable(s) 
	- research hypo
		When a prediction or a hypothesized relationship is to be tested by scientific methods, it is termed as 'research hypothesis'. The research hypothesis is a predictive statement that relates an independent variable to a dependent variable
	- experimental and non-exp hypo
		Purpose - Test research hypothesis
		- Exp - independent variable is manipulated
		- Non Exp - ind var is not
	- experimental and control groups
		usual conditions is control group
	- treatment
		The different conditions under which experimental and control groups are put are usually referred to as 'treatments'.
	- experiment
		The process of examining the truth of a statistical hypothesis, relating to some research problem is known as an experiment. Two types, Absolute and Comparative
	- experimental units(s)
		The pre-determined plots or the blocks, where different treatments are used.

#### Different Research Designs
- In case of **exploratory** research studies
	- Also called formulative research studies
	- Main purpose is that of formulating a problem for more precise investigation or of developing the working hypotheses from an operational point of view
	- The research problem, broadly defined initially, is transformed into one with more precise meaning
	- Methods
		- survey of concerning lit
		- experience survey
		- analysis of 'insight-stimulating' examples
- In case of **descriptive and diagnostic** research studies
	- descriptive is concerned with describing the characteristics of a particular individual, or of a group, whereas diagnostic determine the frequency with which something occurs or its association with something else.
		![[Pasted image 20230925145846.png]]		
- In case of **hypothesis-testing** research studies
	- The researches tests the hypotheses of causal relationships between variables
	- such studies require procedure that will not only reduce bias and increase reliability, but will permit drawing inferences about causality 
- Basic principles of Experimental Design
	- Replication
		- The experiment should be repeated more than once. Thus each treatment is applied in many experimental units instead of one. By doing so the statistical accuracy of the experiments is increased
	- Randomization
		- We should design or plan the experiment in such a way that the variations caused by extraneous factors can all be combined under the general heading of "chance"
	- Local control
		- The extraneous factor, the known source of variability, is made to vary deliberately over as wide a range as necessary and this needs to be done in such a way that the variability it causes can be measured and hence eliminated from the experimental error.
